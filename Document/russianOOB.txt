REPUBLIQUE
GRAND-TACTICAL NAPOLEONIC WARFARE IN MINIATURE



Russian Order of Battle for Borodino
 
This corps system organization is more a variant of the column/wing system (see rules text), but most Russian divisions as they appear in the historical OOB are rather too understrength to function well as full sized divisions in Republique. So for game play purposes we have rolled all but one of the Russian "Corps" for Borodino down one level; with "corps" becoming divisions for game play. The formations have been retitled to match the command level they will represent at game board level in order to prevent confusion (i.e., not referring to a formation as both a division and a corps in the same sentence). The aforementioned process of attrition would continue on in the campaign until the fighting at the Beresina would see entire corps fighting as regimental sized formations. Guard and more valuable reserve formations organized as divisions might retain their higher level command status in the OOB due to having the extra command resources. Thanks to David Oliver for his work on this OOB.

For reference, under each division number is listed in parenthesis the two historical divisions of which it was composed. As noted above, those divisions do not operate as divisions in game play, but knowing which historical divisions were present at the battle can help any players which have identified their wargaming miniatures by pre-1812 historical Division numbers.
